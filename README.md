# Bank_customer_satisfication
Bank customer satisfaction prediction using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and feature selection is a technique that involves using machine learning to predict the level of satisfaction of bank customers. The process involves selecting the most important features that contribute to customer satisfaction and training a CNN model to predict the satisfaction level based on these features.

Feature selection helps to reduce the number of features in the dataset, making it easier and faster to train the model. CNN is a deep learning model that has shown remarkable performance in image classification tasks and has also been applied to non-image tasks, including text and time-series data.

By using CNN, the model can learn complex patterns and relationships in the data, which can improve the accuracy of the prediction. The outcome of this approach is a predictive model that can be used to identify potential areas of improvement for a bank's customer satisfaction levels. Overall, this technique can help banks to better understand their customers and provide better services that meet their needs and preferences.
